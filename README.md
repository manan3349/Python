This repo contains my Python notes from core to expert.

## Basics of Python

### Types of Interpreters:
- We have 2 Methods to run a program or do tasks:
- (a): By writing the code offline like notepad and other softwares like anaconda,etc and running the code
- (b): Or we can do this by online interpreters present such as CMD But they can directly run th o/p.  Eg: like if do x=5 and enter then the value is assigned to x there in online interpreters.
- Online interpreters are also called as Live interpreters.
- Examples are in CMD if we run python and can do anything there then that thing is done live(hand to hand).

`Question: How to read the Entire data of RAM/Memory ?`
`Answer: 

`
- Note: If you create any file with .py extension in the text editor like Notepad in windows then do save in " " (Double quotes) bcz if you save any file with doublequotes then it didn't add any .txt extension with it.

### Variables and Datatypes
- In python you don't need to define a datatype just like you define in other languages eg. in C you define like int x=5; ,but here we don't need to define datatypes because python is smart and it automatically assign datatype at runtime.
- To assign a variable in python: `x=5` ,Here x is assigned by 5 and datatype is int.
- To know or print the data of x: `print(x)` or simply `run x`.
- To know datatype of x: `type(x)` ,here type is a function which defines the datatype of variable.
- This dynamically concept is known as Intellegence or Type inferrence, it means you don't have to define a datatype;on the runtime it will automatically define it.
- If you store anything in a variable inside `" "` or `' '` then the datatype is always a `string`.
- There is no difference in python in " " or ' ' .
- If you want anything in Boolean datatype then do `x= True` or `x=False` where T and F should be in caps and if you do `type(x)` then this will give you as datatype `bool`.
- `Limitation of variable`:Variable is just like a box and we can only store one thing at a time of initializing it.

### Print function and REPL
- To print any variable use `print(x)` or we can do print without using print function, by simply running the variable lets say `x` .
#### `>>>` Symbol is known as REPL which means Read Evaluate Print Loop
- Where `Print` uses print function thats why we can use any variable name direcly or eg. "hii" directly to cmd and get the output as hii.
- Where `Evaluate` means if you write any expression to cmd then it will automatically evaluate that expression we don't need to write any function with it.
- Eg.: 5-2+4-2 in cmd this will automatically give output as 5.
- REPL is the facility of Live interpreter.
- For Live interpreter there is a website available which use REPL tech.
